## How to build
1. Edit premake5.lua so 'targetdir' and 'debugcommand' is updated to match your Mafia II (Classic) directory (never submit these changes though!)
2. Run 'build.cmd' to generate the Visual Studio solution and project.
3. Try and compile
4. Ensure that the MASI2.asi file is stored in the 'scripts' folder of your Mafia II install
5. Ensure you have an asi loader. ThirteenAG's dinput8.dll is usually my goto.
6. Try and run the game
